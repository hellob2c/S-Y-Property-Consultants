BUILD-BASED TAILWIND SETUP (NO FEATURES LOST)

This project still works out-of-the-box because Tailwind CDN is kept.
To switch fully to build-based Tailwind (recommended for production):

1) On your local machine, open a terminal in this project folder.
2) Install dependencies:
   npm install

3) Build Tailwind CSS:
   npm run build
   (or during development: npm run dev)

This generates:
   assets/app.css

4) After verifying app.css looks correct, you can REMOVE the Tailwind CDN script tag from HTML pages
   to make the site 100% build-based.

Notes:
- The Tailwind config includes your brand colors and sets ALL border radius to 0px.
- src/input.css sets base font size to 150% and uses Roboto globally.
